1st of 7 Tasks of Lesson 6

TASK 1
Imagine that Java does not have a division operator.
Write a class that will contain methods for dividing one number by
(we only pass integers to the method input).
Assume that all other arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) exist, only division is missing.
The class should contain three methods:
a method for dividing one number by another without a remainder (for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 3)
a method for dividing one number by another with a remainder (for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 3.333)
a method that returns only the remainder from dividing one number by another, if there is a remainder
(for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 1)
Do this task in two versions (as two separate projects):
implement everything in regular classes
What we practice in this task:
- control structures, branching operations
- constructing algorithms
- static methods and when they are used
- thinking through options for testing code
